# Technical Project 1 
# Peer to Peer Loan Data Analytics
Whilst there are advantages in peer-to-peer lending there are also many risks that are greater than in established financial institutions; 
a relevant example of this for P2P Lending is the underestimation of creditworthiness, and indeed the resultant risk of losses to the lenders. 

The general goal for this project is to provide analytics that will give new insight into risk exposure too Lenders off existing Loans.
